# Settings

These are app wide settings that allow you to configure how PriceBuddy behaves.

## Scraper settings

These settings control how the scraper behaves. The scraper is responsible for
fetching the product details from the product URL.

**Fetch schedule time** - Prices will be scraped once a day, this setting lets 
you control when that happens.

**Scrape cache ttl** - When a page is scraped, it will be cached for this amount 
of time. This is to prevent scraping the same page multiple times in a short period. 
This value is in minutes with the default of `720` minutes (12 hours).

**Seconds to wait before fetching next page** - To avoid being blocked by the
store, we wait this amount of seconds before fetching the next page. The default
is `10` seconds.

**Max scrape attempts** - If the scraper fails to fetch the page, it will retry
this amount of times. The default is `3` attempts.

## Logging

**Log retention days** - The amount of days to keep logs for. The default is `30` days.

## Notifications

This is where global notification settings are configured. For a notification service
to work, it must first be enabled, then the appropriate settings added.

**Email** - Configure the SMTP settings for sending emails.

**Pushover** - Configure the Pushover settings for sending push notifications.

Note: these are global settings, each user must enable the notification method in their
own account settings.

## Integrations

This is where you can configure integrations with other services.

**SearXNG** - [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) is a self-hostable search engine
that can be used to search for products and add them to PriceBuddy. To use this feature, you
must have a SearXNG instance and PriceBuddy must be able to access it. Additionally
SearXNG must be configured to allow returning results as JSON (See the 
[SearXNG documentation](https://docs.searxng.org/admin/settings/settings_search.html#settings-search)).
